Code Explanation:

This code is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation using Keras. It consists of 8 steps:

Steps 1-4: Import necessary libraries, create a small dataset of 4 training images and 4 testing images, normalize the pixel values, and convert class vectors to binary class matrices.

Step 5: Display some training images using Matplotlib.

Step 6: Define a CNN model with several layers, including convolutional, max pooling, dropout, flatten, and dense layers.

Steps 7-8: Compile the model, train it on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data.

Overall, this code demonstrates a basic CNN implementation in Keras, including data preparation, model definition, training, and evaluation.
